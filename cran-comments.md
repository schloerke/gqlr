As of 6/3/17, there is no DOI for 'GraphQL'. https://github.com/facebook/graphql/issues/299 . Maybe by the time for the next release.

Added url references to 'GraphQL' in
  * comment arg of Facebook Author
  * Description:
  * URL:

Thank you,

Pleaes single quote the software name 'GraphQL' and add a reference in
the form <http.....>.
Or is there some reference about the method you can add in the
Description field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>?

    * Rebuttle to NOTEs
      * The code is small, but it is comprised of many R6 objects. This could easily be why the code is larger than what is in the raw code.




## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
